  "summary": "The diff adds an AIVideoPage, navigation between Chat and AI Video, local placeholder clip generation, and a browser download helper. However, because AIVideoPage.tsx is truncated, key acceptance-criteria UI elements (clip preview, per-clip download button behavior, and the share/upload help section) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Each generated clip has a visible preview area or a clearly labeled placeholder preview state on completion.",
      "reason": "A local clip generator is implemented and clips are added to state, but the provided AIVideoPage.tsx content is truncated before any clip list/preview rendering is shown, so the preview/placeholder UI cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Add a Download action for each generated clip; Download triggers a browser download with a video extension; on failure, Download is disabled/hidden and an English error is shown.",
      "reason": "Download utilities and a handleDownload function exist, and error clips include an error string, but the diff snippet is truncated before showing any per-clip Download button, its disabled/hidden behavior on error, or the displayed error message in the UI.",
